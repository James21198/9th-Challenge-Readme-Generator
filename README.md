# 9th-Challenge-Readme-Generator

## What was my project and what have I achieved?

In this project i was tasked with creating a readme file generator through Node JS which i have successfully been able to do by ensuring that when the user runs Node Index.js they are met with a series of questions that when they are answered a readme file is generated with the answers that have typed responded with through the questions that were asked.

I was also taked with ensuring that when the user selects a license that the badge for that license is then displayed at the top of the readme file which i have been able to accomplish through using a switch function.

Finally i was tasked with ensuring that when the user clicks on each of the titles in the table of contents that the readme file then jumps to that specific area.
